# ðŸ¤– Autonomous Robot â€“ Robot Design Module

This project features an autonomous mobile robot developed by **Team RoboCraft** for the **Hawkins Interdimensional Challenge 2024**, hosted by the Department of Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering, University of Moratuwa.

The robot was designed to complete a series of 8 challenging tasks involving line following, color tracking, box manipulation, portal navigation, and terrain traversal â€” all under fully autonomous control. Built using an Arduino Mega, JGA25 encoder motors, Reykha IR sensor array, and a 3D-printed chassis, the robot runs on an onboard 11.1V Li-ion battery and uses intelligent decision-making to adapt to each task without any external input.
